# SalonBroker
A salon broker app problem which I found on upwork.
Create a website in python using the framework flask which functions as broker between hair salons and customers that want to get their hair cut.
The website must have two different login portals (they could be on the same page - just one over another or with selector) - one for salons and one for users.
The salons must enter their: Name, Location, Working time (for each day form the week), Free hours that will be later be appointed by interested users. The salons also need to provide the cost for each type of haircut (there can be any number of types defined by the salon).
From the user side the user must provide his current location(which can be changed later), name, username and sex.
Also there must be three different pages (use simple interfaces, no need to style the pages a lot). One page for the user status (there will be shown the location of the user and other data such as favorite salons, last haircuts).
One page for the salons which will show the status of the salon (free hours and taken hours - think for something like table/calendar in which it will be also shown the type of the haircut selected and the client name).
The last page is the main(index) page which will show a simple picture + description of the project if the user is not logged in. If the user is logged in, it will prompt to select a available hair salon (near to his location) and to select a date and time (depending on the salon availability). When the salon is logged in it will just show the status of the salon.
